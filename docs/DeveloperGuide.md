## **Introduction**
Tracey is a desktop app for University housing committee (Hall Masters) to manage their students and premises.
Tracey is optimized for those that work well with Command Line Interface (CLI). She is equipped with Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an effective user experience.

This is a Developer Guide written to help developers get a deeper understanding of how Tracey is implemented and the reasons this project is done a certain way.
It explains the internal structure and how components in the architecture work together to allow users to command Tracey.
Our team will like to welcome you by means of allowing you admire our work.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The structure of the UI component will be explained here.

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The structure of the Logic component will be explained here.

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The structure of the Model component will be explained here.

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

The structure of the Storage component will be explained here.

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Tracking feature

#### Current Implementation
Currently, **Tracey** helps with 9 different types of command:
1. `add student`
2. `edit student data`
3. `delete student`
4. `find student`
5. `filter statuses`
6. `summarise all data`
7. `help user`
8. `list all data`
9. `clear all data`

This 9 features allow users of **Tracey** to be able to manage the covid situation in the hall.
All 9 features extends from the `abstract` `Command` class.  <br>

The table below summarises the 15 different tracking commands:

| Command                        | Command Word | Purpose                                                               |
|--------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add student`                  | `add`        | Adds a new student profile.                                           |
| `edit student data`            | `edit`       | Edits an existing student.                                            |
| `delete student`               | `delete`     | Delete an existing student.                                           |
| `find student`                 | `find`       | Find an existing student.                                             |
| `filter statuses`              | `filter`     | Filter out a list of students by covid status.                        |
| `summarise all data`           | `summarise`  | Make pie charts out of the data.                                      |
| `help user`                    | `help`       | Provide a how-to-use on this app.                                     |
| `list all data`                | `list`       | List out all students in Tracey.                                      |
| `clear all data`               | `clear`      | Empty the database.                                                   |
| `show email`                   | `email`      | Open email window to copy list of emails.                             |
| `resize result display window` | `resize`     | Resize the result display window based on options with pre-set sizes. |
| `archive database`             | `archive`    | Saves a copy of the working database for archival purposes.           |
| `undo command`                 | `undo`       | Undoes the previous command.                                          |
| `redo command`                 | `redo`       | Redoes the previous command that was undone.                          |
| `import excel file`            | `import`      | Import data from an exisitng excel file.                              |

### Add feature

The add mechanism implements the following sequence and interactions for the method call execute("add NEW_PERSON_TAGS") on a LogicManager object where NEW_PERSON_TAGS refers to the tags of a person to be added.

The original AB3 implementation of the add feature only had a selected general few tags to be used (name, email, address, phone, email). To address our target users for this application, we added the tags block, faculty, matriculation number and covid status.

In order to accommodate this new fields, we added new attributes into the `Person` Class and also created `Block`, `Faculty`, `MatriculationNumber` and `CovidStatus` classes.

This also required changes to `CLISyntax` to include the new prefixes for the added classes.

**Path Execution of Add Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![AddFeatureActivityDiagram](images/AddFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

Modelling the workflow of the `Add` Command, when the user inputs an **Add Command**, the command is checked if the required prefixes are present **and** the parameters of the command are valid. If not valid, a **ParseException** will be thrown. If valid, the parameters are then checked for uniqueness. If it is a duplicate `Person` object, a **CommandException** is thrown. Else, a new `Person` object is created and added to `AddressBook`. Subsequently, the result is printed out to the User.

**Class Diagram of Add Feature is shown below:**
![AddClassDiagram](images/AddClassDiagram.png)

Additionally, there are a few final static messages to be displayed to the user for various scenarios when utilising the AddCommand:

1. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS`:
   - Scenario: Adding of the specified `Person` to the database is successful.
   - Message: "New person added: %1$s" where "%1$s" is the added person's details.
2. `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_PERSON`:
   - Scenario: Specified `Person` already exists in the database due to conflicting `MatriculationNumber`, `Phone` or `Email`.
   - Message: "This person's %s already exists in the address book" where "%s" refers to the unique fields: `Phone`, `Matriculation Number`, `Email`.

**Sequence Diagram of Add Feature is shown below:**

![AddSequenceDiagram/png](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

:information_source: **Note** Replace `NEW_PERSON_TAGS` in the sequence diagram with the tags stated in the notes shown in the sequence diagram.
</div>

When a user inputs an add command, the `execute()` method of `LogicManager` will be called and this will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser`, `AddCommandParser` and `ParserUtil` to check the validity of the input prefixes and parameters. If the input is valid, a `Person` object is instantiated and this object is subsequently used as a parameter to instantiate an `AddCommand` object.

Following this, `LogicManager` will call the `execute()` method of the `AddCommand` object. In this method, the `hasPerson()` method of the `Model` class will be called, checking to see if this person exists in the database. If the person exists, a **CommandException** is thrown. Else, the `addPerson()` method of the `model` is called. Finally, it returns a new `CommandResult` object containing a string that indicates success of Add Command.


### Summarise feature

The summarise mechanism implements the following sequence and interactions for the method call execute("summarise") on a LogicManager object.

In order for this feature to be unique and not overlap what the List feature has to offer, summarise helps to calculate how many
students who are covid positive in each block of the hall, alongside those who are negative and on health risk notice.
This helps the hall masters determine if there is a spread of virus in any particular block.

Tracey will then calculate those that are positive and which faculty they come from. This is helpful to determine if the superspreader
comes from the faculty building itself. The hall masters and leaders can be more certain on their follow up actions to keep
their hall safe.

**Path Execution of Summarise Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![SummariseFeatureActivityDiagram](images/SummariseFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

**Sequence Diagram of Summarise Feature is shown below:**
![SummariseSequenceDiagram](images/SummariseSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SummariseCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

When execute is called on the SummariseCommand object, there are multiple call back to self to anaylse and produce the result back to the Logic Manager.

When a user inputs an add command, the `execute()` method of `LogicManager` will be called and this will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser`.
If the input is valid, an `AddCommand` object will be instantiated.

Following this, `Logic Manager` will call the `execute()` method of the `SummariseCommand` object. In this method,
the `updatedFilteredPersonList` method and `getFilteredPersonList` method of the `Model` class will be called, making sure the list of students are displayed.
After getting the list of students, the `SummariseCommand` object will call its own `summariseAll` method to generate message regarding total number
of covid cases in that hall. `filterByBlock` method is then called on the list again to generate statistics of covid statuses in each block of the hall.
`filerByfaculty` is then called on the list once again to generate statistics of covid statuses in each faculty of students in the hall.

Finally, it returns a new `CommandResult` object containing a string that indicates either failure or success of Summarise Command.
A pop up window with the pie charts aligned to the message response will be generated to aid in the visualisation of data.


### Pie Chart Window feature

#### <ins>How the feature is implemented<ins/>

This feature is implemented using a new class `PieChartWindow` and modifications to `SummariseCommand` and `MainWindow`.
When the user inputs `SummariseCommand`, `SummariseCommand#summariseFaculty()` and `SummariseCommand#summariseBlock()` will
be invoked and puts the necessary data into a `TreeMap` that is a static variable of `SummariseCommand`. In `MainWindow#executeCommand()`,
it will invoke `MainWindow#handleSummarise()` which first check whether the pie chart window is to be display by calling `SummariseCommand#shouldOpenPieChartWindow()`.
If true, `MainWindow#handleSummarise()` will call `PieChartWindow#execute()` to create the pie chart and opens a new window.
The data needed for the pie chart is obtained using `SummariseCommand#getPositiveStatsByFacultyData()` and `SummariseCommand#getCovidStatsByBlockDataList()`.


Below are links for implementation of the classes and its methods:
* [`PieChartWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PieChartWindow.java)
* [`SummariseCommand`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SummariseCommand.java)
* [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)

**Sequence Diagram of Pie Chart Window Feature is shown below:**

![PieChartWindowSequenceDiagram](images/PieChartWindowSequenceDiagram.png)

#### <ins>Why it is implemented that way<ins/>
The data needed for the pie charts should be coupled with `SummariseCommand`, therefore it is necessary to implement this feature in such a way that the pie chart data is created upon invocation `SummariseCommand`. A `PieChartWindow` controller and FXML class is also needed to abstract the creation of the pie charts and opening a new window respectively. The `MainWindow` class is then modified accordingly.

#### <ins>Alternatives considered<ins/>

**Aspect: How data is passed to the pie charts:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `SummariseCommand` will pass in necessary data into data structures (`TreeMap` in this case) upon invocation which then can be obtained using getter methods
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Dependent on the `SummariseCommand` class to pass in correct inputs.
    * Other consideration(s): Use the Singleton design principle for the data structures.

* **Alternative 2:** Parse the feedback to user message from `SummariseCommand`
    * Pros: No modifications to the `SummariseCommand` class.
    * Cons: Dependent on the feedback message, need to implement complicated methods to parse the message, parsing methods need to be modified if the format of the feedback message is changed.

### Help feature

The help mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("help").

What is the help feature

The help feature opens up a separate window that contains a simple user guide for the user to adhere to. The window contains a list of commands that Tracey provides, their formats and examples.
When the Help Window is open, the user can also choose to view the comprehensive user guide on the user's default browser by clicking on the `Open User Guide` button.

The `help` command is as follows:

`help`

The user can choose when to execute the `help` command.

The activity diagram shows the possible execution paths for the `help` command.

**Path Execution of Help Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**

![HelpActivityDiagram](images/HelpActivityDiagram.png)

**Class Diagram of Help Feature is shown below:**

![HelpClassDiagram](images/HelpClassDiagram.png)

**Sequence Diagram of Help Feature is shown below:**

![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)




### Clear feature

The clear mechanism implements the following sequence and interactions for the method call execute("clear") on a LogicManager object.

The original AB3 implementation of the clear feature acts a similar way to how we clear the address list. This clear feature allows
user to replace the list of students with an empty one. Previous data are swiped away.

**Path Execution of Clear Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**

![ClearFeatureActivityDiagram](images/ClearFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

**Class Diagram of Clear Feature is shown below:**
![ClearClassDiagram](images/ClearClassDiagram.png)

Additionally, there is a static final static message to be displayed to the user when utilising the Clear Command:

1. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS`
   - Scenario: Tracey database successfully cleared.
   - Message: "Tracey has been cleared!".


**Sequence Diagram of Clear Feature is shown below:**

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

<br>

### Find feature

#### Current Implementation

The activity diagram below illustrates the flow of a `find` command.

![FindFeatureActivityDiagram](images/FindFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

#### Usage Scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how `find` react and act at each step.

**1**) The user launches the application for the first time.

**2**) The user inputs `find alex` in the CLI to sort all contacts by name. This calls `LogicManager::execute`
to parse the given input.

**3**) `LogicManager` will notice that a find command is called and will call `FindCommandParser::parse`. From the given input,
`FindCommandParser` will create the corresponding `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` Predicate and return a `FindCommand`.

**4**) After execution of the user input, `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand::execute(model)` where model contains methods that lists
out the persons with the `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

**5**) Through a series of method invocations, a lists of persons that matches the input is generated with their personal details.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the execution of `find alex`.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `find` executes**

{to be decided}

<br>

### Edit feature

The edit mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("edit").

#### What is the edit feature

The edit feature allows the user to edit field values of exising student with new values.

The `edit` command is as follows:

`edit 1 n/Poppy p/62536273 ...` where `...` indicates any other additional fields the user wishes to edit.

The original AB3 implementation of this feature allows the same edited value for the corresponding field of the person. `e.g` If a `Person` with `name` of  John (index 1 in the address book) is already present in the address book, then the command `edit 1 n/John` will still work. 
In addition, for attribute types that need to be unique for each `Person` `e.g.``Phone`, `Email` and `Matriculation Number`, the edited value for these unique attribute types still work even if it already exists in the address book. 
<br>`e.g.` If there are two `Person`:
* `name`: John `Email`: john123@gmail.com (Index 1 in the address book)
* `name`: Johnny `Email` johnny123@gmail.com (Index 2 in the address book)
<br> The command `edit 2 e/john123@gmail.com` still works and the new `Email` value for Johnny would be updated to `john123@gmail.com` even though this email already exists in the address book for John and is supposed to be unique for each person in the address book. 
 
In order to address these issues, we have enhanced the `EditCommand` to include `EditCommand#editChecker()` to address the former issue and and `Person#isDifferentPerson()` to address the latter issue.

**Path Execution of Edit Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![EditFeatureActivityDiagram](images/EditFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

**Class Diagram of Edit Feature is shown below**
![EditFeatureActivityDiagram](images/EditFeatureClassDiagram.png)

The class diagram above depicts the structure of `EditCommand`. As per any `Command` class, `EditCommand` needs to extend the abstract class `Command`.

Modelling the workflow of the `Edit` Command, when the user inputs an **Edit Command**, the command is checked if the required prefixes are correct, the index is not out of range **and** fields are of the correct format. If the requirements are not met, a **ParseException** 
will be thrown, else the new field values are then checked against its corresponding field values to be edited for duplicates. If there are any duplicates, a **Command Exception** will be thrown, else the new values that required uniqueness (`e.g.` `Phone``Email` `Matriculation Number`) are checked against the address book
for if it already exists. If it does, a **Command Exception** will be thrown, else the field values to be edited are updated with the new field values as a success message would be shown to the user.

**Sequence Diagram of Edit Feature is shown below:**
![EditFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/EditFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The above figure illustrates the important interactions of `EditCommand` when the user successfully edit the `name` attribute of the student at index 1 to Poppy.

When a user inputs an `EditCommand`, `LogicManager#execute()` will be invoked and this will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser`, `EditCommandParser` and `ParserUtil` to check the validity of the input index, prefixes and parameters. If the input is valid, a `EditPersonDescriptor` object is instantiated and this object is subsequently used as a parameter to instantiate an `EditCommand` object.
The `EditCommand` object is then passed back to the `LogicManager` which will then invoked `EditCommand#execute()`. This execute method will call two other helper methods `EditCommand#editChecker()` and `Person#isDifferentPerson()`, which both are not shown in the sequence diagram and is used further validation.
The main functions of these two methods are to check if the new values are duplicate of the corresponding fields to be edited and if the new values for fields that requires uniqueness already exists in the address book respectively.
The `ObservableList` in the `Model` class then updates the display of the contacts, placing the edited person to the bottom of the list (or placing it at the last index).

TThe `ObservableList` is a JavaFX class which observes and automatically changes the list once an update is performed.

### Filter feature

The filter mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("filter").

#### What is the filter feature

The filter feature allows users to retrieve a list of specific students, filtering them by covid status, and/or faculty, and/or block.

The `filter` command is as follows:

`filter cs/[COVID STATUS] f/[FACULTY] b/[BLOCK]`

The user can choose whether to input filter criteria for some or all of the fields. However, at least one field must be specified. <br>

The user can thus choose different combinations of filter criteria depending on the motive. For example, if a block head wants to cater to the covid-positive students in a certain block, the user can simply filter by both covid status and block to find out the details of this group of people.

eg.
`filter cs/positive f/soc` <br>
This is still a valid input even though the filter criteria for block was not specified. The resultant list will contain students who are both covid-positive and from the faculty "SOC".

The activity diagram shows the possible execution paths for the `filter` command.

**Path Execution of Filter Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![FilterFeatureActivityDiagram](images/FilterFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

There are two possible execution paths for this command.

1. User inputs the `filter` command with invalid or empty arguments. A ParseException will be thrown, and Tracey will display an error message along with the correct input format to the user.
2. User inputs the `filter` command with valid arguments. Tracey then stores the specified filter criteria, and displays a list based on those criteria.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between objects during the execution of a `filter` command.

**Sequence Diagram of Filter Feature is shown below:**
![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The arguments typed into Tracey's text box will first be taken in by the `execute` method in `LogicManager`. It will then be parsed by the `parseCommmand` function in the `AddressBookParser` object.

A `FilterCommandParser` object will then be created to parse this input, with its `parse` function. A `FilterDescriptor` object is then created, containing the filter criteria that the user has entered. This `FilterDescriptor` object is then used to create a `FilterCommand` object.

Subsequently, the `parseCommand` method in `LogicManager` will continue to create a `CommandResult`, displaying a success message and a list of the filtered students.

The `ArgumentMultimap` class is used to parse the user input and store the filtering criteria, based on the respective prefixes of the different fields. This was used so that the input criteria of each field can be taken from the user input irregardless of the order that they typed it in.

The `FilterDescriptor` takes in the filter criteria and returns a single predicate encompassing all the criteria on its `getFilters` method, so that this predicate can be used as an argument for the `updateFilteredPersonsList` method of the `Model` object, displaying a list of students that were filtered by this predicate.

### Email Feature

The email mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("email").

#### What is the email feature

The email feature opens up a separate window containing the emails of the students found in the current list displayed. The email feature allows a user to copy the email list to their clipboard to paste in their email platform of choice.

The `email` command is as follows:

`email`

The user can choose when to execute the email command.

The activity diagram shows the possible execution paths for the `email` command.

**Path Execution of Email Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![EmailActivityDiagram](images/EmailActivityDiagram.png)

There are two possible execution paths for this command.
1. User inputs `email` command. After the Email Window opens, the user can choose copy the emails in the list by clicking on the copy email button. After which, the user can close the Email Window.
2. User inputs `email` command. After the Email Window opens, the user chooses not to copy the emails in the list. After which, the user can close the Email Window.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between objects during the execution of a `email` command.
![EmailSequenceDiagram](images/EmailSequenceDiagram.png)


When a user inputs an email command into the Tracey, the `executeCommand()` method of `MainWindow` will be called and this will call the `execute()` method of `LogicManager`. This will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser`,  which then instantiates an `EmailCommand` object.

Following this, the `LogicManager` will call the `execute()` method of the `EmailCommand` object. In this method, a `CommandResult` object will be instantiated.

Back in the `MainWindow`'s `executeCommand()` method, it will then call the `handleEmailWindow()` method which will then instantiate an `EmailWindow` object.

Afterwards, the `LogicManager` calls the `show()` method of `EmailWindow` and the `EmailWindow` will be shown to the user.



### Exit Feature

The exit mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("exit").

#### What is the exit feature

The exit feature allows users to exit from Tracey after they finish with it.

The `exit` command is as follows:

`exit`

The user can choose when to exit the programme <br>

The activity diagram shows the possible execution paths for the `exit` command.

**Path Execution of Exit Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![ExitFeatureActivityDiagram](images/ExitFeatureActivityDiagram.jpg)

There is one possible execution path for this command.

1. User inputs the `exit` command, triggering Tracey to close its programme

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between objects during the execution of a `exit` command.

**Sequence Diagram of Exit Feature is shown below:**
![ExitSequenceDiagram](images/ExitFeatureSequenceDiagram.jpg)


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Data archiving feature

The archive mechanism implements the following sequence for the method call execute("archive") on a LogicManager object.

#### what is the archive feature
This feature allows the user to save a copy of the working database, which can be then used for archival purposes such as future reference or restore the database back to a working version.

The `archive` command is as follows:
`archive`

This command will save a copy of the working database at a file path which is dependent on the user's local computer's time and date. 
When the user uses this command, a folder named `archive` will be created if it is not yet created at the directory relative to the database file.
Inside this `archive` folder will contain subdirectories named after the user's computer local date in `DDMMYY` format and inside these subdirectories will contain the archived files which is named after the user's computer
local date and time in `DDMMYYHHmmssSSS` format. The reason this format is used is to ensure that all archived files name are unique.

#### <ins>How the feature is implemented<ins/>
The archive command will save the archived file into a subdirectory of a directory relative to the address book file path.
`ArchiveCommand#initArchiveFilePath()` will produce the archived file path using the directory path of the address book file as the base directory.
e.g. If the address book file is saved in `[ROOT]/data`, then a directory called `archive` will be saved in `[ROOT]/data` and the
subdirectories will be saved as `[ROOT/data/[LOCAL_PC_DATE]` and the archived file path is `[ROOT]/data/[LOCAL_PC_DATE]/[ARCHIVED_FILE]`.
`FileUtil#createIfMissing()` will create a dummy file at the archive file path.
The address book file will then be copied over to this dummy file at the archived file path using `Files#copy()`.

Below are links for implementation of the classes and its methods:
* [`FileUtil`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util/FileUtil.java)
* [`ArchiveCommand`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/ArchiveCommand.java)
* [`Files#copy()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#copy(java.io.InputStream,%20java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.file.CopyOption...))


**Class Diagram of Archive Feature is shown below:**
![ArchiveFeatureClassDiagram](images/ArchiveCommandClassDiagram.png)

The class diagram above depicts the structure of `ArchiveCommand`. As per any `Command` class, `ArchiveCommand` needs to extend the abstract class `Command`.

**Path Execution of Archive Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![ArchiveFeatureActivityDiagram](images/ArchiveFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

Modelling the workflow of the `Archive` Command, when the user inputs an **Archive Command**, the command is checked if there are any extra parameters. If there is, a `CommandException` will be thrown, else the command then checks if the 
working database file to be archived is present. If it is not present, a `CommandException` will be thrown, else the command then proceeds to copy the file. If there is an error copying the file, a `CommandException` will be thrown, else 
the archived file will be saved in its respective file path and a success message will be shown to the user.

**Sequence Diagram of Archive Feature is shown below:**
![ArchiveFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The above figure illustrates the important interactions of `ArchiveCommand` when the user successfully archived the current working database file.

When a user inputs `archive`, `LogicManager#execute()` will be invoked and this will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser` to check if there are any extra parameters. If the input is valid, the file path of
the working database file is obtained using `Model#getAddressBookFilePath()`. A dummy copy of the archived file is then created at its file path using `FileUtil#createIfMissing()`, after which the data from the 
working database file is copied over to this dummy file using `Files#copy()`. If the archived file is successfully created and copied, the user can then find this file at its file path.

### Resizing result display window feature

#### what is the resize feature
This feature allows the user to resize the result display window in the case they have a small application window size, and/or they want to have a better view at the result feedback text after keying in a command, which is especially true for the `SummariseCommand`
which displays quite a long result feedback text.

The `resize` command is as follows:
`resize 1`

This feature provides the user with three different resizing options to choose from, which are `1`, `2` and `3` with each number being a multiplier of the default result display window size (1 being the default size).

**Class Diagram of Resize Feature is shown below:**
![ResizeFeatureClassDiagram](images/ResizeCommandClassDiagram.png)

The class diagram above depicts the structure of `ResizeCommand`. As per any `Command` class, `ResizeCommand` needs to extend the abstract class `Command`.

**Path Execution of Resize Feature Activity Diagram is shown below:**
![ResizeFeatureActivityDiagram](images/ResizeFeatureActivityDiagram.png)

Modelling the workflow of the `Resize` Command, when the user inputs a **Resize Command**, the command is checked if the parameter is valid. If it is invalid, a `ParseException` will be thrown, else the result
display window in the GUI is resized according to the user's option. A success message is then displayed to the user.

**Sequence Diagram of Resize Feature is shown below:**
![ResizeFeatureSequenceDiagram](images/ResizeFeatureSequenceDiagram.png)

The above figure illustrates the important interactions of `ResizeCommand` when the user successfully resizes the result display window.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ResizeCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

When a user inputs `resize 1`, `MainWindow#executeCommand()` will be invoked which in turn calls `LogicManager#execute()`. This will trigger a parsing process by `AddressBookParser` and `ResizeCommandParser` to check for valid command type and parameters.
This will then create a `ResizeCommand` object which is then executed by the `LogicManager` via `ResizeCommand#execute()` which will then update the value needed to set the result display window size. This value is used by the `MainWindow#handleResizeResultDisplayWindow()`
which sets the window in the GUI according to the user's desired option.
